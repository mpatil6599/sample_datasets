Hello, to anyone reading this review.
I joined the Big Data (BD) course by Sumit Sir last year (Dec 2021) with some experience in the software/python and IT domain. Although I did not have extensive experience specifically with BD tools and technologies, I found this course content to be extremely good and easygoing in order to digest the content while being professionally employed. The self-paced and weekly lectures were well organized and the difficulty of topics increased in an incremental manner from week 1 to week 20. The course portal has been well designed and the topics are well separated which makes it easier to find them. The support team at TrendyTech is helpful and highly available.
I recommend this course and would suggest anyone who takes this course to put in honest 10-12 hours every week. You will come out as a BD champion after 20 weeks!

Best of luck!
