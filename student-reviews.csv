Hello, to anyone reading this review.
I joined the Big Data (BD) course by Sumit Sir last year (Dec 2021) with some experience in the software/python and IT domain. Although I did not have extensive experience specifically with BD tools and technologies, I found this course content to be extremely good and easygoing in order to digest the content while being professionally employed. The self-paced and weekly lectures were well organized and the difficulty of topics increased in an incremental manner from week 1 to week 20. The course portal has been well designed and the topics are well separated which makes it easier to find them. The support team at TrendyTech is helpful and highly available.
I recommend this course and would suggest anyone who takes this course to put in honest 10-12 hours every week. You will come out as a BD champion after 20 weeks!

Best of luck!

I am experienced professional with very less knowledge on Big data. I came to know about Summit and Trendytech from one of my friend. I joined the online course and and was happy to choose this one. The course contain indepth  knowledge from basics to advance level. Also the advantage of the course is that even after the course is completed in 24 weeks we have got access to material for another 6 months. So we can easily go and see the video and study materials if needed in the span of time. I am very  happy to join the course. Thank you so much Sumit and Trendy Tech for providing me the guidance.
